- README.md
- FIXME's in code
- check live/* and warn if removed files might need config changing (also grep /etc, /usr/local/etc for /var/lib/acme/live/xxxxxxx" ?)
- nagios-local-multi cron check add (if acmetool installed)
- put in debian package

- extra tools:
	- check if all symlinks (and/or their destinations) in /var/lib/acme/live are newer than 3 months
	- check if all FQDNs in names of /var/lib/acme/live resolve in DNS (to that machine IP?)
	- check if all FQDNs contained in /var/lib/acme/desired/* resolve in DNS (to that machine IP?)
	- if we are removing desired/FQDN1-XXXXXX, and there exist another desired/FQDN1-YYYYY then probably no 
	  config needs changing, but if it was only desired/FQDN1-*, that we should recommending grepping for 
	  "acme/live/FQDN1" in /etc to fix configs to use superset-certificate instead of old one which will 
	  not be updated any more
	- parse certificates in /var/lib/acme/certs and see if there are any expired ones
	- psql https://crt.sh/ checker for problems for any host in our specified domain example.com (as nagios plugin)
	  (check if there are duplicate requested cert in less than 30 days for same hostnames, or coming from unknown IPs)
